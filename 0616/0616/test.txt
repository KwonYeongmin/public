This is the story of how I died.
But don't worry, this is actually a very fun story.
And the truth is, it isn't even mine.
This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel.
And it starts, with the sun.
Now, once upon a time,
a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens.
And from this small drop of sun,
grew a magic, golden, flower.
It had the ability to heal the sick, and injured.
Oh, you see that old woman, over there?
You might want to remember her.
She's kind of important.
Well, centuries pass and a hop, skip and
a boat ride away, there grew a kingdom.
The kingdom was ruled by a beloved King and Queen.
And the Queen, well she was about to have a baby,
and she got sick, really, sick.
She was running out of time.
And that's when people usually start to look for a miracle.
Or in this case, a magic golden flower.
Ahhh, I told you she'd be important.
You see instead of sharing the suns gift,
this woman, Mother Gothel, hoarded it's healing power
and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years.
And all she had to do, was sing a special song.
*Flower gleam and glow, let your power shine*
*Make the clock reverse, bring back what once was mine*
*What once was mine*
All right, you get the jist. She sings to it, she turns young,
creepy, right?
We found it!
The magic of the golden flower, healed the queen.
A healthy baby girl, a princess was born.
With beautiful golden hair.
I'll give you a hint.
That's Rapunzel.
To celebrate her birth,
the King and Queen launched a flying lantern into the sky.
And for that one moment, everything was perfect.
And then that moment ended.
Gothel broke into the castle
and stole the child, and just like that...gone.
The Kingdom searched and searched,
but they could not find the Princess.
For deep within the forest In a hidden tower.
Gothel raised the child as her own.
bring back what once was mine, what once was mine.*
Gothel had found her new magic flower.
But this time she was determined to keep it hidden.
Why can't I go outside?
The outside world is a dangerous place.
Filled with horrible, selfish people.
You must stay here, where you're safe.
Do you understand, flower?
Yes, Mommy.
But the walls of that tower, could not hide everything.
Each year on her birthday,
the King and Queen released thousands of lanterns
into the sky.
In hope that one day, their lost Princess, would return.
